# Configuration

It's default value is **false**. 

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qmjhnfw/Capture2.png" alt="Capture2" border="0"></a>

Turn it to **true** if you wanna feel swimming effects when swimming ingame.

As this is a game where you swim a lot it is deactivated by default.
